				I came across code for the first time in JSS3, building simple applications with <em>Visual Basic</em>. Unfortunately, things happened and I parted ways with it and everything I learnt. A couple of years later, passion drove me to code again but this time it was Game development. I first tried C++, then switched to Game Maker language ( Game Maker studio). I had a lot of fun using this until I eventually got frustrated about the fact that I couldn't progress much anymore due to my limited knowledge in graphics. I stopped Game Maker and picked up Java about 5 months later. A week later and I was learning HTML and CSS instead. It was interesting that this time that I could interact and see what I was coding as I progressed. I think this in particular was what made me to stop Game development. That I was exhausting so much time into learning it and I couldn't come up with something concrete as it was basically as if I was alone in the whole Nigeria due to lack of communities etc.

				Okay, so web was the way forward and I learnt pretty fast. I spent little time learning JS and just skipped forward to PHP because I read online that Facebook was built with it and that was what enabled sites to have login and sign up features, etc. Looking back, I kind of regret that decision because if I had someone to guide me, I would have learnt Javascript instead. Do I hate PHP ? Nope. I love that I know the language as it has helped me in rapid development of web applications over time however if we want to be factual, the hype is in Javascript right now and they get paid higher and are respected more.

				I heard about the Dufuna software engineering scholarship last year and I was really interested due to the fact that it was going to be core training for software engineers. I mean, this was why I switched departments in school from Agricultural Engineering to Computer science. I love computers, so I love the calculations too ( well, as long as <s> calculus </s> isn't involved -_-). I love algebraic calculations and just applying reasoning to problems. I looked through the curriculum and boy o boy was I glad!!! At the end of this program I would be extremely good I thought to myself.

				Looking down the program, I would say that it didn't really turn out as expected. The program started really well but then unfortunately things just dwindled <small> down </small>. It seemed as though they didn't have our time anymore ( I understand and I do not feel entitled at all but I am just stating my experience ). The highlight of it all was when I discovered that the curriculum had changed. Initially we started Python and we were supposed to go deeper into Python using flask and all; you know, core engineering stuff. One faithful day, I see that we are stopping Python (abruptly) and we would be learning HTML and CSS instead. It broke my heart to say the least.

				However, like Miss Ibironke said to me, I wouldn't allow that to deter me, they have shown me some sort of foundation and I would just keep pushing until I become the <strong> software engineer </strong> that I have always wanted to become.
